The purpose of this project is to make it easy to get all the code for
Confident CAPTCHA.  It is possible that no one other than me needs
this functionality.

To use it:

    git clone git://github.com/ConfidentTech/confidentcaptcha-all.git confidentcaptcha-all
    cd confidentcaptcha-all
    cp my_projects.template.txt my_projects.txt
    # Uncomment any project where you want a read-write working copy
    vim my_projects.txt
    ./init_all_projects.sh

Contact jwhitlock if you have a library you'd like to add.
